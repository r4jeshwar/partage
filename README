partage
=======

File upload system based on HTTP.

Features
--------
+ Simple web interface
+ Link expiration
+ Mimetype support
+ Random filnames
+ Multiple file uploads
+ Privilege dropping
+ `chroot(2)`-ed

Usage
-----
Refer to the partage(1) manual page for details and examples.

	partage [-v] [-f partage.conf]

Configuration is done from its configuration file, partage.conf(5).
The format is that of the INI file format.

The following configuration will accept connections via fastcgi over
UNIX sockets. On startup the server will chroot into /var/www, and drop
privileges to the www:daemon user:

	bind   = unix:/tmp/partage.sock
	chroot = /var/www
	user   = www
	group  = daemon
	maxsize = 2147483648 # 2 Gib

Configuration
-------------
In order for the web interface to work, the server needs access to 2
template files, which must be location specified by the `tmplpath`
variable:

- index.html
- upload.html

Interface
---------
Files are sent to the server using PUT and POST requests.
Using POST requests, one can set the expiration time by sending the
"expiry" parameter (in seconds).

	curl -X PUT -T file.png http://domain.tld
	curl -X POST -Fuck=file.png -Fexpiry=3600 http://domain.tld

Installation
------------
Edit the `config.mk` file to match your setup, then run the following:

        $ mk
        # mk install
